This compendium began as a collection of documents used a teaching materials, to supplement software-agnostic textbooks about structural equation modeling (SEM).  Materials were originally developed for a University of Amsterdam course (search [here](https://studiegids.uva.nl/) for a description of the course "structural equation modelling in educational research") taught by [Frans Oort](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1823-7105) and [Suzanne Jak](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2223-5594) using the [`OpenMx`](http://openmx.ssri.psu.edu/) package, and later adapted for the [`lavaan`](https://lavaan.ugent.be/) by Suzanne Jak, [Mathilde Verdam](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2479-8817), and [Terrence D. Jorgensen](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5111-6773). The latest version of the materials were compiled into the current compendium by Suzanne Jak and Terrence D. Jorgensen using [RMarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/), and assisted by [Lennert J. Groot](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8711-6086) to compile the separate chapters into a [`bookdown`](https://bookdown.org/) project hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/TDJorgensen/SEM-in-Ed-compendium).
